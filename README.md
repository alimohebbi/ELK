## Install Elasticsearch
Required steps are same as official docs for  [elasticsearch-7 installation guide](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.1/deb.html).
It is easier to install from debian package because it is require less configuration specially for running elasticksearch as a service.
